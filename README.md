# Wrath of Ancient Egypt
This Ludo like game was made by Hanneke & Maurits, as part of the assignments for the TU Delft's CSE1500 <a href="https://github.com/chauff/Web-Teaching#assignments" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Web&Database course</a>.

We started off with the idea to go in the style of the famous Doodle Jump game/childish drawings, but upon watching Indiana Jones we decided to combine the two. The name diverts of both the theme of the game 'ancient Egypt', and the Dutch name for Ludo which is something like 'don't get angry', therefore -> Wrath. 

Alle assets have been drawn by ourselves, and let's say some worked out better than others in the short amount of time we gave ourselves.. Of course more theming could be added (like pyramids, mummies etc.)  But this assignment was not about the design part, so we decided it would be fine for now.
