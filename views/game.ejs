            <hr>
            <p>
            When you start Ludo, you see a squared board. On this board there is a pattern in the shape of a cross. Every arm of the cross is divided into three columns of eight squares. The middle column has the colour of the corresponding player, and other players cannot land there. In each corner, there are 4 squares of the same colour where each of the pieces of each corresponding player begin.</br> 
            Each player chooses a colour and they take turns in clockwise order.  To start playing on the board with a piece, the player must throw 6 with the dice. Then the piece starts at the coloured square close to the 4 home squares. When there are more pieces than 1 of a player on the board, the player decides which one will move. Also, when a player throws 6, he can take another turn.</br>
            If a piece lands on another piece, the piece that is landed on is returned to its starting squares.</br>
            A player wins when all 4 pieces have navigated over the whole board, and are situated in the home column. Only with an exact throw it is possible to move a piece into the home column.
